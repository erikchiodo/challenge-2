The goal of this Challenge was to accomplish the follow Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work:

    > WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
    > THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

    > WHEN I load their portfolio
    > THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them

    > WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
    > THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

    > WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
    > THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

    > WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
    > THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

    > WHEN I click on the images of the applications
    > THEN I am taken to that deployed application
